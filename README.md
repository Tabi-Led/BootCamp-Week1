# Code Refactor Starter Code
Challenge 1 wanted semantic elements that followed an intuitive flow. All HTML has been cleaned up to reflect semantic html that allows accessabilty features to be used on the homepage 
All images have unique descriptors for screen readers 
Classes have been added for CSS purposes (nav bar buttons so I could align and size down the font)
Background color has been changed
All commits have descriptive messages
Issues have been created and closed out to keep project organzied (and aspiring developer on task)
Created branches for each challenge I faced and worked on separate branches to avoid breaking the project and having to start over
